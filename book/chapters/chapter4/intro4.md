#### Note to students
This chapter focuses mainly on hydraulic loads. It will elaborate on key aspects of loads for dikes along the sea, rivers and lakes in addition to describing geotechnical boundary conditions in {numref}`sec:geotech_boundary_conditions`. This chapter gives a general introduction to the most relevant loads that need to be considered in dike design. For more details on hydraulic loads, students are referred to the lectures of CIE5308 (Breakwaters and closure dams), CIE4310 (Bed, Bank and Shore Protection), CIE3330 (Hydraulic Structures) and CIE4325 (Ocean Waves). More information on the geotechnical loads can be found in lecture CIE4367 (Design of Embankments).
