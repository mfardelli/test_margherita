# 3. Flood Risk Analysis

## Note to students
Sections with required knowledge for the course CIE5314 Flood Defences are Sections [3.1.1](subsec-gen-intro), [3.2](sec-gen-approach)-[3.4.2](subsec-calc-fail-prob), [3.7](sec-flood-risk-ana)-[3.7.1](subsec-quant-floodrisk), [3.8.1](subsec-gen-con)-[3.8.3](subsec-societal-risk) and [3.9.3](subsec-res-saf-stand). The other sections provide more contextual and background information. It is still recommended to read these sections.

## Learning objectives
After studying the chapter on flood risk analysis students are able:
- To understand and explain the basic concepts of flood risk analysis;
- To perform a basic / simplified flood risk analysis and quantify the risks for a given system using different risk metrics (economic risk, individual risk, societal risk);
- To perform a (simplified) reliability analysis of flood defences at the section and system level - also using a basic understanding of the length effect and dependency;
- To (quantitatively) evaluate the effect of risk reduction measures;
- To understand describe how the new safety standards for flood defences in the Netherlands have been derived.

The section on flood risk analysis could also serve as a background and reference document for students and professionals that want to perform a quantitative flood risk analysis.
