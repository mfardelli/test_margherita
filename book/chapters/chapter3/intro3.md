# 3. Flood Risk Analysis

#### Note to students
Sections with required knowledge for the course CIE5314 Flood Defences are {numref}`Subsec:gen_intro`, {eq}`Sec:gen_approach`-{eq}`Subsec:calc_fail_prob`, {eq}`Sec:Flood_risk_ana`-{eq}`Subsec:Quant_floodrisk`, {eq}`Subsec:Gen_con`-{eq}`Subsec:SR` and {eq}`Subsec:Res_saf_stand`. The other sections provide more contextual and background information. It is still recommended to read these sections.

#### Learning objectives
After studying the chapter on flood risk analysis students are able:
- To understand and explain the basic concepts of flood risk analysis;
- To perform a basic / simplified flood risk analysis and quantify the risks for a given system using different risk metrics (economic risk, individual risk, societal risk);
- To perform a (simplified) reliability analysis of flood defences at the section and system level - also using a basic understanding of the length effect and dependency;
- To (quantitatively) evaluate the effect of risk reduction measures;
- To understand describe how the new safety standards for flood defences in the Netherlands have been derived.

The section on flood risk analysis could also serve as a background and reference document for students and professionals that want to perform a quantitative flood risk analysis.
