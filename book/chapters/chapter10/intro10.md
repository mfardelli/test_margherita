# 10. From safety standards to safety assessment and design

#### Note for students
This chapter describes how requirements for the design and safety assessment of flood defences can be derived based on a given acceptable failure probability. Firstly, in {numref}`Sec:ss_gen_princ`, some general principles are introduced. Secondly, section [10.2](Sec:rel-bas_req) introduces how specific requirements for the design and safety assessment of flood defences can be derived using probabilistic and a semi-probabilistic approaches. The elaborations equally apply to design of (new) flood defence structures and to safety assessment of existing structures. For the course on Flood defences, the following knowledge is required; all of {numref}`Sec:ss_gen_princ`; section [10.2.1](Subsec:RBR-intro) - section [10.2.3](Subsec:Distr_sect); and basic principles of [10.2.4](Subsec:Der_designvalues) and [10.2.5](Subsec:Calibration), but not all details.

#### Learning objectives
After studying this chapter students are able:
- To understand and explain the meaning of the new safety standards and how they are used in design and safety assessment
- To derive the required failure probability at the section and failure mechanism level (for a given set of factors)
